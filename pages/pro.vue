    <p>Like most developers, you're either getting paid based on your skills... or you're busy trying to snag a higher-paying gig where you are.</p>
    <p><strong>Knowledge and skill equals money.</strong></p>
    <p>I put in hours upon hours of research when preparing a course, condensing complex topics into something you can pick up five or ten minutes at a time.</p>
    <p>More importantly, I'm focusing on the types of problems you'll see in a real professional setting, not the toy problems you'll see everywhere else.</p>
    <p><strong>I'm not going to waste your time.</strong></p>

    <p>No fluff.</p>
    <p>No flash.</p>
    <p>Just a new videos every week, ready to help you to effortlessly level up your skills.</p>
    <p>Your career is worth the investment.</p> -->
