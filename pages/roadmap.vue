    <h1>Roadmap</h1>

    <h2>Mid to late December: Open Beta</h2>
    <p>This open beta should be feature-complete for finding and watching videos.</p>
    <p>Things could be a little rocky at first as I adjust based on user feedback.</p>
    <p>As such, there will be a MAJOR discount for those who believe in the project this early.</p>

    TODO
    <ul>
      <li>Finish Courses feature</li>
      <li>Finish Email-related features</li>
      <li>Upload all update introductions and conclusions</li>
      <li>Intersperse MirageJS videos where appropriate</li>
      <li>Assign videos to courses</li>
      <li>Assign tags where appropriate</li>
      <li>Attach domain, connect analytics, add privacy policy, basic SEO stuff, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Early to mid January: Launch</h2>

    <p>At this point we'll be ready for prime time. Prices raise, and I'll start releasing a new video most workdays.</p>
